### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > * `pwd` show current working directory path
> > * `mkdir` create a directory
> > * `rmdir` delete a directory
> > * `touch` create an empty file
> > * `rm` delete a file
> > * `mv`  rename (or move) a file
> > * `ls -a` list all files (including hidden)
> > * `cp` copy a file from one path to another (maybe in another directory)
* `cd` change working directory
* `pushd, popd` temporarily change working directory and save current working directory. popd returns you to previous working directory
